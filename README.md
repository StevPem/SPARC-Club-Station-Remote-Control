# SPARC - Club Station Remote Control

This project describes the SPARC (Southern Peninsula Amateur Radio Club) club station remote control project.

It aims to record the overall intent, architectural decisions, design details, and any implementation specifics.

This is also a bit of an experiment in agile methods and how they can be applied to solution architecture.
